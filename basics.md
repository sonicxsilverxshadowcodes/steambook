# Basics – Context of the Syllabus

This document gives a short overview of the **STEAM** syllabus: what it is, who it’s for, and how it’s organised. The syllabus has **two parts**: Electronics & IoT and Computational Thinking.

---

## What is this syllabus?

- It is the **syllabus for a Grade 6 STEAM course** in two parts:
  - **Part 1: Electronics & IoT** – simple concepts about matter, electricity, circuits, components, measurement, and AC/DC.
  - **Part 2: Computational Thinking** – learning to think like a computer: apps, blocks, events, drawing, controls, logic, and motion/games.
- It is **exam-oriented**: each chapter is linked to specific exam questions so you know what to focus on. Part 1 and Part 2 each have their own question set (e.g. Part 1: Q1–Q20; Part 2: Q1–Q20).

## Who is it for?

- **Grade 6** students (or anyone learning these topics for the first time).
- Part 1: Learners who want a clear path from **atoms and electricity** to **circuits, components, measurement, and AC/DC**.
- Part 2: Learners who want to understand **what apps are**, how to build them with **blocks** (e.g. Thunkable), and basics of **events, drawing, sliders, logic, and game-style motion** (e.g. PictoBlox).

## How is it organised?

### Part 1: Electronics & IoT (Chapters 1–9)

1. **Inside Matter – Atoms, Charges & Electricity**  
   What things are made of, what an atom is, and what “electricity” means (flow of electrons).

2. **Conductors, Insulators & Semiconductors**  
   Why some materials conduct and others don’t; what makes semiconductors special.

3. **Electric Circuits – Battery, Current & Safety**  
   What a circuit is, its main parts, direction of current, and basic safety rules.

4. **Resistors & LEDs – Controlling Electricity**  
   How resistors limit current and why LEDs need them; what a potentiometer is.

5. **Measuring Electricity – Multimeter**  
   Using a multimeter for voltage, current, and resistance; what “OL” or “1” means.

6. **Resistor Color Code – Reading Values**  
   How to read resistor value and tolerance from color bands.

7. **Breadboard & Circuit Building**  
   Using a breadboard for temporary circuits; LED polarity and common mistakes.

8. **Simulating Circuits – Tinkercad**  
   What simulation is and why we use Tinkercad to practice circuits.

9. **AC vs DC & Electrical Waveforms**  
   Difference between AC and DC; frequency; sine, square, and triangle waves; function generator.

### Part 2: Computational Thinking (Chapters 10–16)

10. **What Is an App & How Apps Work**  
    What an app is; examples (calculator, game, drawing); native apps; why we use block-based apps.

11. **Understanding Blocks in Thunkable**  
    What blocks are; Math, Logic, Control, and Text blocks; variables.

12. **Events – Making Apps Respond**  
    What an event is; examples (button click, screen open, slider move); why events are important.

13. **Canvas & Drawing Apps**  
    What a canvas is; what changes while drawing (color, width, path); Touch Drawing; clearing the canvas.

14. **Sliders & Controls**  
    What a slider is; when it triggers (on Value Change); using sliders for brush size or drawing width.

15. **Building Smart Apps (Logic in Real Life)**  
    Age calculator; showing output with labels and Text-to-Speech; error messages; case sensitivity; clearing inputs.

16. **Motion & Game Coding (PictoBlox)**  
    X-axis (horizontal movement); “change x by”; why motion blocks matter in games and animations.

## How does it relate to the exam?

- Each chapter in the **detailed syllabus** (`syllabus.md`) lists which **exam questions** it covers (e.g. Part 1: Q1, Q3 for Chapter 1; Part 2: Q1, Q2 for Chapter 10).
- **Part 1** prepares you for its set of questions (e.g. Q1–Q20 for Electronics & IoT).
- **Part 2** prepares you for its own set of questions (e.g. Q1–Q20 for Computational Thinking).
- For a full breakdown of topics, learning outcomes, and question mapping for both parts, use **`syllabus.md`**.

## Summary

- **Purpose:** Grade 6 STEAM – Part 1: Electronics & IoT; Part 2: Computational Thinking. Simple concepts, exam ready.  
- **Content:**  
  - Part 1: Atoms → materials → circuits → components → measurement → breadboard → simulation → AC/DC and waveforms.  
  - Part 2: Apps & blocks → events → canvas & drawing → sliders → logic & smart apps → motion & game coding.  
- **Use:** Read **`basics.md`** for context; use **`syllabus.md`** for the full syllabus and exam links for both parts.
