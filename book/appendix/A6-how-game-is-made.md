## From Idea to the Game You Play

A **game** is a program that has **rules**, **goals**, and **interaction**: the player does something (move, tap, shoot), and the game responds (character moves, score changes, level loads). Making a game starts with an **idea**: what kind of game? Puzzle, runner, shooter, story? Then the team decides the **rules** (how you win, lose, or score) and the **feel** (fast, slow, funny, scary).

**Designers** plan the **levels** or **screens**, the **characters**, and the **story** (if any). **Artists** draw or model the characters, backgrounds, and objects—either by hand or with software. **Programmers** write the **code** that makes everything work: movement (like the “change x by” and “change y by” you used in PictoBlox), collisions (did the player touch an enemy or a coin?), score, lives, and switching levels. **Sound designers** add music and effects (jump, collect, game over).

Small games can be made with **block-based** tools (Scratch, PictoBlox) or simple game builders. Big games use **game engines** (e.g. Unity, Unreal)—special software that handles graphics, physics, and lots of characters at once. The team **tests** the game again and again to fix bugs and make it fun. Finally, the game is **released** on a store (e.g. Steam, App Store, Play Store) or a website.

So: **idea → rules and design → art and sound → code (movement, collision, score) → test → release**. When you move a sprite with “change x by” or add a score variable, you are doing a tiny part of what game developers do—and that’s how you can get curious about making your own games!
