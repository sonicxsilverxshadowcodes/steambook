## From Code to the Page in Your Browser

A **website** is a set of **pages** that live on a **server** (a computer that is always connected to the internet). When you type a web address or click a link, your **browser** (Chrome, Safari, etc.) asks the server for that page. The server sends back **files**—usually written in **HTML** (structure: headings, paragraphs, images, links), **CSS** (style: colours, fonts, layout), and **JavaScript** (behaviour: buttons that do something, forms, animations). The browser **reads** these files and **draws** the page on your screen.

Making a website starts with **planning**: What pages do we need? Home, About, Contact? What should each page show? Then **designers** decide how it should look (layout, colours, fonts). **Developers** write the **HTML** (the content and structure), **CSS** (the look), and **JavaScript** (the interactivity). They often use **editors** (e.g. VS Code) and **frameworks** or **templates** to work faster. The files are then **uploaded** to a **hosting** service (a place that runs the server), and the site gets an **address** (e.g. www.example.com).

So in short: **plan → design → write HTML/CSS/JavaScript → upload to a server → users open the address in a browser**. Websites can be simple (a few static pages) or complex (shopping, social media, apps that run in the browser). Learning a little HTML and CSS—or using a simple site builder—is a great first step to get curious about how the web works and how every page you visit was made by someone writing code and putting it on a server!
