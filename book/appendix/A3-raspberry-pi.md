## What Is a Raspberry Pi?

A **Raspberry Pi** is a **small computer** (about the size of a credit card) that has a processor, memory, USB ports, and often Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. You connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse (or use it “headless” over the network), and it runs an **operating system** (usually Linux). So unlike an Arduino (which runs one program and has no full OS), a Raspberry Pi is a **real computer**: you can browse the web, write code, play media, and also control **GPIO pins** (general-purpose input/output) to talk to LEDs, sensors, and motors. It is used in schools, hobbies, and small projects (robots, media centres, small servers).

## Raspberry Pi vs Arduino

| | Arduino | Raspberry Pi |
|--|---------|--------------|
| **What it is** | Microcontroller board (runs one program) | Small full computer (runs an OS) |
| **Typical use** | Control LEDs, motors, sensors; simple logic | Computing + GPIO; can run many programs, internet, desktop |
| **Programming** | Upload one sketch (C/C++ style) | Many languages (Python, Scratch, etc.); can code on the Pi itself |
| **Power** | Low; good for battery | More power; usually needs a power supply |

Both can control electronics (LEDs, sensors); the Pi can also do heavy computing, internet, and display.

## What Can You Do With It?

- **Learn coding** — Use Scratch, Python, or other languages on a real computer.
- **Control electronics** — Use GPIO to blink LEDs, read sensors, drive motors (like Arduino but with a full OS).
- **Build projects** — Weather station, robot, home automation, small server, media player.
- **Use the internet** — Browse, run small web servers, or connect to online services.

## A Bit of History

The Raspberry Pi was created in the UK by the **Raspberry Pi Foundation** (first model in 2012). The goal was to make a cheap, small computer so that more students could learn computing and programming. Millions have been sold, and it is now used in schools and by makers worldwide.

## Key Points

- Raspberry Pi is a small **full computer** with an OS (usually Linux); Arduino is a **microcontroller** that runs one program.
- The Pi has **GPIO pins** so you can control and read electronics (LEDs, sensors) like with Arduino, plus do normal computing (internet, desktop, many programs).
- It is used for learning, projects, robots, and small servers. The Foundation made it to help students learn computing.
