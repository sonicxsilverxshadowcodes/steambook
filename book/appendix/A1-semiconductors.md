# A1: Semiconductors

**Appendix – Going Further**

## What Are Semiconductors?

**Semiconductors** are materials that conduct electricity **only under certain conditions**—unlike metals (conductors), which conduct easily, and insulators, which hardly conduct at all. The most common semiconductor is **silicon**. By adding tiny amounts of other elements (“doping”) and by building tiny structures on a chip, we can make switches, amplifiers, and sensors that are the basis of computers, phones, and almost all modern electronics.

## Why Do They Matter?

| Use | Where you see it |
|-----|-------------------|
| **Transistors** | Millions or billions on one chip (CPU, memory). |
| **LEDs** | Lights and displays (phones, TVs, traffic lights). |
| **Solar cells** | Convert light to electricity. |
| **Sensors** | Light, temperature, magnetic field (cameras, thermometers). |

Without semiconductors we would have no smartphones, no internet as we know it, and no small, powerful computers.

## A Bit of History

- **1947:** First **transistor** at Bell Labs (Bardeen, Brattain, Shockley)—replaced large vacuum tubes.
- **1950s–1960s:** **Integrated circuits** (many transistors on one chip) were developed (e.g. Jack Kilby, Robert Noyce).
- **Silicon Valley** grew around companies that made chips and computers. Today chips are in almost every electronic device.

## One Idea: Doping

**Doping** means adding a very small amount of another element to silicon. This creates either extra negative charge carriers (n-type) or extra “holes” that act like positive carriers (p-type). Where n and p meet we get a region that can **block** or **allow** current depending on voltage—that is the basis of diodes and transistors. So “semi” means we **control** when the material conducts, and doping is one way we do that.

## Key Points

- Semiconductors (e.g. silicon) conduct only under certain conditions.
- They are used in chips, LEDs, solar cells, and sensors.
- The transistor and the integrated circuit made modern electronics possible.
- Doping (adding impurities) helps control whether and how the material conducts.
