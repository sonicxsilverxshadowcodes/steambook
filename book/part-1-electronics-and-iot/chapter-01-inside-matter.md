## What Is Everything Made Of?

**Figure 1.1 – From matter to atoms:** Everything we see and touch is made of matter; matter is made of atoms.

Look around you. Your desk, your pencil, the wire of a charger, the screen you are reading on—even your own hands—are all made of the same kind of tiny building blocks. Scientists call these building blocks **atoms**. Just as a wall is made of many bricks, everything in the world is made of many, many atoms. They are so small that you cannot see them with your eyes; you need very powerful microscopes to “see” them. A single drop of water has more atoms in it than there are people on Earth!

| Idea | Simple explanation |
|------|---------------------|
| Atom | The smallest unit of ordinary matter that still has the properties of an element (e.g. copper, carbon). |
| Matter | Anything that has mass and takes up space (solids, liquids, gases). |
| Element | A pure substance made of only one type of atom (e.g. gold, oxygen, silicon). |

**Real-life link:** When you touch a metal railing, you are touching trillions of atoms. When you switch on a light, electrons (tiny parts of atoms) move through the wire and make the bulb glow. So electricity is connected to the same “stuff” that everything is made of—atoms.

## Inside an Atom

**Figure 1.2 – Structure of an atom (simplified):** The nucleus has protons and neutrons; electrons move around it.

              +  NUCLEUS        +
              +  protons (+)    +
              +  neutrons (0)   +
              +++++++++++++++++++
                         •
                    •         •
                         •
```

An atom is like a tiny solar system. In the centre there is a **nucleus** (like the Sun), and around it there are even smaller particles. The three main parts you need to know are:

| Part | Charge | Where it is | What it does |
|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Proton** | Positive (+) | Inside the nucleus | Helps hold the atom together; number of protons decides the *element* (e.g. 6 protons = carbon). |
| **Electron** | Negative (–) | Outside the nucleus, moving around | Can leave one atom and move to another; **flow of electrons = electricity**. |
| **Neutron** | No charge (neutral) | Inside the nucleus | Helps keep the nucleus stable; no electric charge. |

**Exam tip:** The particle with a **negative charge** is the **electron**. Electrons are the ones that move when we use electricity.

**Real-life link:** In a battery, chemical reactions push electrons out from one terminal (negative) and pull them in at the other (positive). When you connect a wire and a bulb, those moving electrons carry energy and make the bulb glow.

## What Is Electricity?

**Flowchart 1.1 – When do we have electricity?** Electricity needs a closed path and moving electrons.

```mermaid

    A[Is there a complete path for electrons?] -->|No - open circuit| B[No current. No electricity.]
    A -->|Yes - closed circuit| C[Is there a voltage push?]
    C -->|No| B
    C -->|Yes| D[Electrons flow. We have electric current!]
```

Electricity is **not** a thing you can hold. It is the **flow of electrons** from one place to another. If electrons do not move, there is no electric current—even if the wire is full of electrons. Think of a pipe full of water: water only “does work” when it *flows*. Similarly, electrons only give us light, sound, or motion when they *flow*.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| Electricity (in everyday use) | The flow of electrons in a path (e.g. a wire). |
| Electric current | The amount of charge (electrons) passing a point per second; measured in Amperes (A). |
| No flow | If the path is broken (open circuit), electrons cannot flow, so there is no electricity. |

**Figure 1.5 – Simple circuit (closed vs open):** When the path is complete, current flows; when it is broken, current stops.

```

       |      |      |                          |      |      |
       +------+------+                          +      X      -
       |   Wire     |                          |   (break)   |
       +------+------+                          +-------------+
       |   Bulb     |                                 
       +------+------+                          Bulb does NOT glow
       Electrons flow → Bulb glows
```

**Real-life examples:**

- **Light bulb:** Electrons flow through the filament; it gets hot and glows.
- **Phone charging:** Electrons move from the socket through the cable into the battery.
- **Lightning:** A huge rush of electrons through the air from clouds to the ground.

## A Little History

The idea that matter is made of small particles goes back to ancient thinkers, but the **modern picture of the atom** started in the 1800s and early 1900s:

- **John Dalton** (around 1808) proposed that matter is made of atoms.
- **J.J. Thomson** (1897) discovered the **electron** (the negative particle).
- **Ernest Rutherford** (early 1900s) showed that the atom has a tiny, heavy nucleus.
- **Niels Bohr** (1913) proposed a simple model of electrons moving in orbits around the nucleus.

Their work helped us understand why some materials conduct electricity (electrons can move easily) and others do not.

## One Level Higher: Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm’s Law

To go a bit deeper, we use three ideas that engineers and electricians use every day. They are linked by **Ohm’s Law**.

**Figure 1.3 – The three quantities in a simple circuit:** Voltage pushes current through resistance.

```
    +  Battery (Voltage V)   -     Wire (low resistance)     Bulb / Resistor (Resistance R)
    |================|  ------>  Current I flows  ------>  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
         "Push"                    (Amperes)                    "Opposition"
```

### Voltage (V)

**Voltage** is like the “push” that makes electrons want to move. It is measured in **Volts (V)**.

- A battery gives a voltage between its two terminals (e.g. 1.5 V for a small cell, 9 V for a square battery).
- Higher voltage (with a proper circuit) means a stronger push, so more electrons can flow—like turning up the pressure in a water pipe.

| Example | Approximate voltage |
|--------|----------------------|
| AA battery | 1.5 V |
| USB (phone charger) | 5 V |
| Car battery | 12 V |
| Home socket (India) | 230 V (dangerous—never touch) |

### Current (I)

**Current** is *how many* electrons pass through a point in the circuit every second. It is measured in **Amperes**, or **Amps (A)**.

- A small LED might need only 0.02 A (20 milliamps).
- A bulb might use 0.5 A. More current usually means more brightness or more power, but too much can damage parts (like an LED) or cause heating.

### Resistance (R) – What Are Ohms?

**Resistance** is how much the material “holds back” the flow of electrons. The unit of resistance is the **Ohm**, written as **Ω** (the Greek letter omega). One **ohm (1 Ω)** means: when we apply **1 volt** across that thing, **1 ampere** of current will flow through it. So:

- **Ohm** = unit of resistance.
- **More ohms** = more opposition to current = less current for the same voltage.
- **Fewer ohms** = less opposition = more current for the same voltage.

Wires have very **low** resistance (a fraction of an ohm over short lengths). Resistors are components that add a **controlled** resistance (e.g. 100 Ω, 330 Ω, 1 kΩ) to limit current and protect parts like LEDs.

| Resistance | Meaning (rough idea) |
|------------|-----------------------|
| 0 Ω (wire) | No opposition; current flows easily (limited by the rest of the circuit). |
| 330 Ω | Moderate opposition; often used with LEDs on a 5 V or 9 V supply. |
| 10 kΩ | High opposition; only a small current flows for the same voltage. |

### Ohm’s Law – The Three Forms

A scientist named **Georg Simon Ohm** (1789–1854) found that voltage, current, and resistance are related in a simple way:

**Voltage = Current × Resistance**  
\[ V = I \times R \]

From this one equation we can find **any one** of the three if we know the other two:

| To find | Formula | In words |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Voltage (V)** | \( V = I \times R \) | Multiply current by resistance. |
| **Current (I)** | \( I = \frac{V}{R} \) or I = V ÷ R | Divide voltage by resistance. |
| **Resistance (R)** | \( R = \frac{V}{I} \) or R = V ÷ I | Divide voltage by current. |

**Figure 1.4 – Ohm’s Law triangle:** Cover the quantity you want to find; the remaining two show the operation.  
- Cover **V** → I and R are side by side → **V = I × R**  
- Cover **I** → V is over R → **I = V ÷ R**  
- Cover **R** → V is over I → **R = V ÷ I**

```
        V
       /|\
      / | \
     /  |  \
    I --+-- R
        |
   V = I × R   |   I = V ÷ R   |   R = V ÷ I
```

### Worked Examples Using Ohm’s Law

**Example 1 – Finding voltage (V)**  
A current of 0.02 A (20 mA) flows through a resistor of 330 Ω. What is the voltage across the resistor?

- **Formula:** V = I × R  
- **V** = 0.02 × 330 = **6.6 V**  
So the voltage across the resistor is **6.6 volts**.

---

**Example 2 – Finding resistance (R)**  
A 9 V battery is connected to an LED. We want the current through the LED to be 0.02 A. The LED itself “uses” about 2 V. So the voltage across the resistor must be 9 − 2 = 7 V. What resistor value should we use?

- **Formula:** R = V ÷ I  
- **R** = 7 ÷ 0.02 = **350 Ω**  
We pick the nearest standard value, e.g. **330 Ω** or **390 Ω**. So we need a resistor of about **330 Ω** to limit the current safely.

---

**Example 3 – Finding current (I)**  
A 12 V battery is connected across a resistor of 600 Ω. How much current flows?

- **Formula:** I = V ÷ R  
- **I** = 12 ÷ 600 = **0.02 A** (or 20 mA).  
So **0.02 amperes** (20 milliamps) of current flows.

---

**Example 4 – Another voltage calculation**  
A 1.5 V cell is connected to a small bulb. The current is 0.3 A. What is the resistance of the bulb (approximately)?

- **Formula:** R = V ÷ I  
- **R** = 1.5 ÷ 0.3 = **5 Ω**  
So the bulb has a resistance of about **5 ohms**.

**Flowchart 1.2 – Using Ohm’s Law:** Decide what you need to find, then use the right formula.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[What do I need to find?] --> B{Quantity?}
    B -->|Voltage V| C[Use V = I × R]
    B -->|Current I| D[Use I = V ÷ R]
    B -->|Resistance R| E[Use R = V ÷ I]
    C --> F[Put in known values and calculate]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

**Summary of the relationship:** If voltage goes up and resistance stays the same, current goes up. If we add more resistance (e.g. a bigger resistor), current goes down. That is why we put a resistor in series with an LED—to limit current so the LED does not burn out.

## Key Points to Remember

| Point | Short explanation |
|-------|--------------------|
| Everything is made of atoms | Atoms are the tiny building blocks of matter. |
| Atom has protons, electrons, neutrons | Protons (+) and neutrons in nucleus; electrons (–) outside. |
| Electricity = flow of electrons | No flow → no current → no “electricity” in the wire. |
| Electrons carry negative charge | They are the particles that move in wires and circuits. |
| Voltage (V), current (I), resistance (R) | Voltage = push (Volts); current = flow (Amperes); resistance = opposition (Ohms). |
| Ohm’s Law | V = I × R; to find **V** use V = I × R; to find **I** use I = V ÷ R; to find **R** use R = V ÷ I. |
| Ohm (Ω) | Unit of resistance; 1 Ω means 1 V produces 1 A through that resistance. |
