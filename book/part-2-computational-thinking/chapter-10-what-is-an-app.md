## What Is an App?

An **app** (short for **application**) is a **computer program** that is made to do a **specific job**. When you open an app on your phone, tablet, or computer, it runs a set of instructions that someone (a programmer or a team) wrote. Those instructions tell the device what to show on the screen, what to do when you tap a button, and how to save or use data. So an app is not the phone itself—it is the **software** that runs on the phone and does a particular task for you.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **App (Application)** | A program that does a specific job on a device |
| **Software** | Programs and instructions that run on hardware (phone, computer) |
| **Hardware** | The physical device (screen, battery, chips) |

**Real-life examples:**

- **Calculator app** → Its job is to calculate numbers when you type and tap operations (+, −, ×, ÷).
- **Game app** → Its job is to let you play a game (move a character, score points, follow rules).
- **Drawing app** → Its job is to let you draw or paint on the screen with your finger or a stylus.
- **Weather app** → Shows weather and forecasts.
- **Camera app** → Takes photos and videos using the device’s camera.

So different apps do different jobs, but they all are **programs** made to do something specific.

## What Is a Native App?

A **native app** is an app that is **downloaded and installed** on your device (phone or tablet) and **runs directly** on that device. It is stored in the device’s memory and uses the device’s camera, sensors, and screen. You open it by tapping its icon. It does not need a web browser to run—it runs on its own.

| Feature | Native app |
|---------|------------|
| **Where it lives** | Installed on the device (phone/tablet) |
| **How we get it** | Download from an app store (e.g. Google Play, App Store) |
| **How it runs** | Directly on the device’s operating system (e.g. Android, iOS) |
| **Examples** | Camera app, WhatsApp, games, calculator, drawing apps |

**Real-life link:** When you install WhatsApp or a game from the Play Store, you are installing a native app. It works even when you are offline (for many features), because the program is on your phone.

## Why Do We Use Block-Based Apps?

Writing programs by **typing code** (text like `if x > 5 then ...`) can be difficult for beginners. **Block-based** apps (like Thunkable, Scratch, App Inventor) let you build programs by **dragging and dropping blocks** instead of typing. Each block is an instruction (e.g. “show a message,” “when button clicked,” “set variable to 10”). You snap blocks together like puzzle pieces. This makes coding:

- **Easier** — No spelling or syntax errors; you choose from ready-made blocks.
- **Fun** — You see results quickly and can focus on logic and ideas.
- **Less confusing** — You do not have to remember exact words or punctuation.

Many schools use block-based tools to teach **computational thinking** first; later, students can learn text-based languages (like Python or JavaScript) if they want.

| Block-based | Text-based |
|-------------|------------|
| Drag and drop blocks | Type code in a language (e.g. Python, Java) |
| Fewer typing mistakes | Need to type exactly right (syntax) |
| Good for beginners | Used by professionals and advanced learners |
| Example: Thunkable, Scratch | Example: Java, Swift (for Android/iOS apps) |

## A Little History

- **Software applications** grew with the first computers. Early “apps” were programs run on big machines by scientists and the military.
- **Personal computers** in the 1980s brought word processors, games, and educational programs.
- **Smartphones** (from the late 2000s) made “apps” a household word. **Apple’s App Store** (2008) and **Google Play** (earlier Android Market) let people download thousands of apps.
- **Block-based coding** for education took off with **Scratch** (MIT, 2007) and later **App Inventor** and **Thunkable**, so that even children could build apps without typing code first.

## One Level Higher: How an App Runs (From Code to Screen)

When you tap an app icon, the **operating system** (e.g. Android or iOS) **loads** the app’s code from storage into **memory (RAM)**. The device’s **processor (CPU)** then **executes** the instructions one by one: draw the screen, wait for touch, run “when button clicked” logic, update the display, and so on. So an app is always a **sequence of instructions** that the hardware runs. In block-based apps, the blocks you arrange are **converted** (by the tool) into instructions that the phone can run—either as an **interpreted** script or by building a **native** app that you install. Understanding that “tap → event → run blocks → update screen” helps you see why **events** (like “when button clicked”) are so important: they tell the app **when** to run which instructions.

| Step | What happens |
|------|----------------|
| You tap the app | OS loads the app into memory |
| App shows screen | Code draws buttons, labels, images |
| You tap a button | “Button click” event runs the blocks you set for that button |
| App updates | New text, new screen, or new action appears |

## Key Points to Remember

- An **app** is a **computer program** that does a **specific job** (calculator, game, drawing, etc.).
- A **native app** is **downloaded and installed** and **runs directly** on the device (e.g. Camera, WhatsApp).
- **Block-based apps** (e.g. Thunkable) let us build programs by **dragging and dropping blocks**—easier, fun, and less confusing than typing code at the start.
- An app runs when the device **loads** its code and the **processor executes** the instructions; **events** (like button click) decide **when** which instructions run.
