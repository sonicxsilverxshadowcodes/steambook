## Appendix – Going Further

Folder: **`appendix/`**

| Section | File | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| A1 | A1-semiconductors.md | Semiconductors, doping, transistors, chips |
| A2 | A2-arduino.md | Arduino, microcontroller, IDE, setup/loop |
| A3 | A3-raspberry-pi.md | Raspberry Pi, full computer, GPIO, vs Arduino |
| A4 | A4-embedded-electronics.md | Embedded systems, where they are, inputs/outputs |
| A5 | A5-how-mobile-app-is-made.md | How a mobile app is made (idea → design → code → store) |
| A6 | A6-how-game-is-made.md | How a game is made (idea → design → art → code → release) |
| A7 | A7-how-website-is-made.md | How a website is made (HTML, CSS, JS, server, browser) |

A5, A6, and A7 are short (about 200–300 words each) to spark curiosity.

## How to Use This Book

1. **Follow the order** — Part 1 then Part 2 (or as your teacher suggests).
2. **Read the theory** and use the **tables** to revise.
3. **Try the examples** (circuits on breadboard or in Tinkercad; small apps in Thunkable).
4. **Do the MCQs** at the end of each chapter to check understanding.
5. **Use the appendix** when you want to go further (semiconductors, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, how apps/games/websites are made).
