# STEAM | Detailed Syllabus

**Grade 6 | Simple Concepts | Exam Ready**

---

This document is the full syllabus for the STEAM course in two parts:

- **Part 1: Electronics & IoT** (Chapters 1–9) – atoms, circuits, components, measurement, AC/DC.
- **Part 2: Computational Thinking** (Chapters 10–16) – apps, blocks, events, drawing, controls, logic, motion & games.

Each chapter lists learning outcomes, core content, and the exam questions it covers. Part 1 and Part 2 each have their own question set (e.g. Part 1: Q1–Q20; Part 2: Q1–Q20).

## Chapter 1: Inside Matter – Atoms, Charges & Electricity

### Scope
- Composition of matter; structure of the atom; link between charges and electricity.

### Learning Outcomes
- State that everything is made of atoms.
- Name the three main parts of an atom and their charges.
- Define electricity as the flow of electrons.
- Identify the particle that carries negative charge (electron).

### Content

#### 1.1 What everything is made of
- Everything around us—tables, wires, phones, our bodies—is made of **atoms**.
- Atoms are very small particles; many materials are made of huge numbers of them.

#### 1.2 Inside an atom
An atom has three main parts:

| Part     | Charge        | Symbol / note |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Proton   | Positive (+)  | In the nucleus |
| Electron | Negative (–)  | Moves; can leave atom |
| Neutron  | No charge     | Neutral; in the nucleus |

**Exam focus:** The particle with **negative charge** is the **electron**.

#### 1.3 What is electricity?
- Electricity is **not** a substance or material.
- Electricity is the **flow of electrons** from one place to another.
- Example: When you switch on a light, electrons move through the wire and the bulb glows.

#### 1.4 Key points to remember
- Electricity = flow of electrons.
- Electrons carry negative charge.
- If electrons do not move, there is no electric current.

### Exam Coverage
- **Q1, Q3**

- **Most common example:** Silicon.
- **Uses:** Chips, computers, mobile phones, LEDs, solar cells.

#### 2.5 Why semiconductors are special
- They can behave like a **conductor** sometimes and like an **insulator** sometimes.
- That is why they are called **“semi” conductors**.
